    body: `Boris Johnson used a government private jet to fly home from a weekend with his family in Cornwall, prompting questions about use of taxpayer-funded resources.

    The prime minister was in Cornwall and Devon on the weekend before the Tiverton and Honiton byelection, in which his party lost to the Liberal Democrats.
    
    He made a surprise visit to the Royal Cornwall Show on the Friday morning and then was photographed by holidaymakers with his family on the beach at St Ives over that weekend, as well as making a party political visit to Tiverton at some point to campaign in the byelection.
    
    Johnson also made a trip to Hayle, near St Ives, on the Monday morning where he visited a factory and helped pack broccoli.
    
    Records show that a government plane left London to fly to Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose, a helicopter base near the tip of Cornwall, not far from St Ives, early on the Monday morning. The use of the government plane was first reported by the Sunday Mirror.
    
    The ministerial code states: “Ministers must ensure that they always make efficient and cost-effective travel arrangements. Official transport should not normally be used for travel arrangements arising from party or private business, except where this is justified on security grounds.”
    
    Family are allowed to accompany ministers if it is “clearly in the public interest”, the code says.
    
    A No 10 spokesperson said: “All travel decisions are made with consideration for security and time restraints. The PM is accompanied on government business by a delegation of staff, which is taken into consideration as part of ensuring taxpayer value for money. This was the sole reason for the plane being used to transport the PM and his staff back from this particular visit.”
    
    Johnson’s use of government planes has long been under scrutiny. He was accused of “staggering hypocrisy” after it emerged that he flew back to London from the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow by private jet to go to a dinner at a men-only private members’ club.
    
    He also took a private jet to Blackpool in February despite the train journey taking only three hours.
    
    In 2018, as foreign secretary, Johnson complained that he wanted his own private government plane as the prime minister’s was rarely available and was too grey.
    
    He said on a trip to Buenos Aires: “The taxpayers won’t want us to have some luxurious new plane, but I certainly think it’s striking that we don’t seem to have access to such a thing at the moment. What I will say about the Voyager, I think it’s great, but it seems to be very difficult to get hold of. It never seems to be available. I don’t know who uses it, but it never seems to be available. And also, why does it have to be grey?”`,

    body: `JMW Turner is revered as a genius landscape painter, the king of the turbulent maritime scene, but much less is known about the more private side of the artist. Specifically: Turner and sex.

    The curators of a new exhibition, Between the Sheets, Turner’s Nudes, hope to change that by displaying rarely seen erotic watercolour drawings that he made over the course of his career.
    
    \nThe works will go on display in his former home in Twickenham and shine a different light on the artist.
    
    “I think he was very interested in sex, and why shouldn’t he be?” said Franny Moyle, Turner’s biographer and a co-curator of the project. “He was a human being like the rest of us. Some of the drawings are from life classes; others are more erotic, intimate bedroom scenes. “Parental or guardian discretion is advised,” the organisers of the display are telling visitors.

    \nA number of the drawings were made during Turner’s frequent visits to Petworth House in West Sussex in the 1820s and 1830s. Petworth was the home of Lord Egremont, an enthusiastic art collector and patron to Turner. Egremont is thought to have fathered at least 40 illegitimate children.
    
    Jacqueline Riding, another co-curator of the show, said Petworth seemed to have had “quite a free and easy environment. There was certainly no discouragement to a relaxed atmosphere.”
    
    It was important to remember also, said Riding, that Turner, who lived from 1775 to 1851, was essentially a Georgian artist. “I know he is often seen as Victorian because he lived into the Victorian age, but he was a Georgian with Georgian appetites.”`,

    body: `The risk of catastrophic gas blasts is being heightened by cash-strapped homeowners skipping checks for potentially deadly faults, safety experts have warned.

    \n Cookers, fires and boilers left unchecked can cause leaks, which “lead to fires and explosions that cost lives and shatter neighbourhoods,” said Bob Kerr, the gas services director at Gas Safe Register.
    
    The body, which operates under agreement with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), found that almost one in three householders will skip booking an annual gas safety check this year, due to the cost-of-living crisis. A boiler service costs about £80 while a gas safety check for three appliances costs about £60.
    
    The warning comes as investigators concluded a gas leak from internal piping was responsible for huge explosion last Sunday at a house in Kingstanding, Birmingham that killed Doreen Rees-Bibb, 79, and critically injured a man.
    
    \n The incident is the latest in a series of rare but devastating blasts in the past two years caused by faulty appliances or broken gas mains from Portsmouth to Yorkshire.
    
    Four gas explosions that destroyed homes examined by the Guardian have been caused by defective appliances or canister supplies inside homes. Three more were caused by gas seeping into properties from cracked or corroded mains supply pipes, a problem that is being tackled by a national gas mains replacement programme, which has another 10 years to run.
    
    \n The Birmingham blast adds to 12 other fatalities and 179 injuries caused by gas explosions and fires in Great Britain in the past five years, according to figures from the HSE. On average, there have been 31 blasts a year, often leaving communities and homeowners traumatised.`,
